# LuxeyUI

LuxeyUI is a tailwindCSS UI component library built on top of PostCSS and
TypeScript for basic use. It features components inspired by
[shadcn-ui](https://ui-shadcn.com) and [@nextui-org](https://nextui.org),
tailored for non-react use.

> **Note:** This project is currently under development. Expect more components
> to be added in the future. Stay tuned! ðŸ˜€

## Getting Started

To kick off, use the CDN for now since the components aren't usable
individually. Full functionality will be available after the 1st full release.
Utilize the Tailwind CDN for better customization.
